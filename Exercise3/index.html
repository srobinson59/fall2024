            <h4><b>A HANDMADE WEB<br>by J.R. Carpenter</b></h4>
            <h3>According to J.R. Carpenter, a website is a digital
                manifestation of ideas, stories, and connections. They serve
                as a means of learning more about someone or something
                and interacting with them. When he refers to the
                concept of the 'handmade web' it enriches his definition
                of a website, emphasizing the personal touch that goes into
                designing a website. <br><br>
                Throughout the article, Carpenter highlights the fact that websites
                function as an extension of ourselves. They let us communicatethings about ourselves and allow us to engage with others. Just as
                we have a digital presence on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc.websites give us the liberty to create a more curated, specific digital presence, with a more personal touch.<br><br>
                Carpenter doesn’t really believe that websites will become obsolete.
                He believes that they will persist in changing over time. From the
                beginning of the internet until now there is a drastic change in what’s possible through web design. Now everything is so customizable, even down to the fact that you can change people’s cursor when they visit your site. <br><br>
                I agree with Carpenter in the sentiment that websites will get bigger and better as time goes on. I also think that he brings up an
                important point that websites are meant to be 'handmade'. The
                personal touch just makes websites feel more authentic and like more care has been put into them.</h3>

            <h4><b>MY WEBSITE IS A<br>SHIFTING HOUSE<br>by Laura Schwulst</b></h4>
            <h3>In Laurel Schwulst view, a website isn’t just 'a file or a bundle of files living on a server somewhere', they allow web designers to be both the 'author and architect simultaneously'. She states that the possibilities of what a website can be are endless, so there’s no real definition of what a website is, it’s whatever you want it to be. She believes that websites are important because they allow us to create 'works' and 'the world'. For Schwulst, websites won’t become obsolete because they allow for endless opportunities, they can be anything. </h3>

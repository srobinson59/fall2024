                <h4>When you arrive at loveamika.com,<br><i>This is what you see</i></h4><br>
                <h5>Amika's branding includes bold and funky colors and patterns, so it's only right that their website has a clean, sleek base as to not clash with their product photos.<br>
                <br>
                As you scroll down the homepage, you are encourage to shop the site, they highlight some deals that they have going on at the moment, and promote their blog and rewards program.<br>
                <br>
                Because their product photos are so dynamic, that is what would catch a viewers attention. There are not any pop ups, at least in this session that I've used the site, but there are some floating buttons encouraging customers to "spin to win" some sort of discount, or chat with a chatbot. </h5>

            <h4>Based on what I've seen,<br><i>Here is my analysis</i></h4><br>
            <h5>The bold, funky colors and patterns really highlight the product and draw a viewers attention to the products. I will admit that their products really caught my eye in Sephora a few years ago and that's why I tried them. So not only is their packaging captivating and effective on their website, but also in store.<br>
            <br>
            They use sans-serif and lowercase type throughout the website, which matches their packaging really well. Overall, it feels really cohesive and nothing sticks out in a negative way.<br>
            <br>
            I think that the website has a really inviting feel. It encourages users to explore different facets of the brand (products, blog, rewards). Like I mentioned before, there are not pop-ups that feel invasive, but they do have floating buttons that remain in the bottom corners of the website, so that if a customer needed to chat with the chatbot or wanted to spin for a discount before they checkout, they can at any time.</h5>

            <br>
            <h5>It is pretty easy to see that Amika's goal is to sell hair care products. But upon further inspection, I have interpreted their website to be one that is not only committed to making clean products that promote healthy hair, but they also want to make this type of clean hair care accessible to everyone. I think that it is rare to see a hair care brand that caters to such a wide range of people, and based on their marketing, photos, and product line, it is clear that they want to make haircare more inclusive.</h5>

                <h2>My name is Savannah Robinson. I am a senior New Media and Digital Design Major at Fordham University with a Visual Arts Minor and a concentration in Art, Text, and Design. My first two years of college I was a psychology major and I started to make the switch to the artistic space in the last semester of my sophomore year. Throughout my junior and senior years at Fordham I have taken the following courses that relate to my major, minor, and concentration:

                </ul></div>
                Most recently, this semester I am taking Logos, Branding, and Presentation and Fundamentals of Website Design. Looking to the future, next semester, I am taking Visual Effects and Motion Graphics, and Representation in Art.<br>

                In my personal life, some of my favorite activities include hanging out with friends, my family, and my dog, Lulu (seen left). I also love to watch movies *shameless letterboxed plug* you can find me on letterboxed as savshirob52 (i rarely use it and when I do I'm not the toughest critic, but I swear I'll start using it more).</h2>
